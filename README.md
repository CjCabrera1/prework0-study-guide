## Description
This project was built with the intentions of introducing basic coding skills. This application will hold any notes that are taken during class. By the end of the term will be used to study. This study guides blends functionality with practice, taking notes about coding while coding. I learned how to code in HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript during this whole process.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
